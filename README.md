# cs115notes
A collection of notes + code from CS115 (intro to cs) at Stevens Institute of Technology - **IN PROGRESS**  
Topics for CS115 include: design; algorithmic thinking; recursion; object-oriented programming; ethics in computer science; and some basics about computer systems: machine language, interpreters, compilers, and data representation  
- syllabus attached in repo  
- code in "class code" folder  
- all my notes included in "cs115_notes_humna.pdf" (might not be the best notes for self-learning, but it includes all classwork)  
- practice tests included :)
